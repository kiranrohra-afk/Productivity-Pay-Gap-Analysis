# Productivity-Pay-Gap-Analysis

# Section 0: Background and Purpose
This is an analysis of the productivity pay gap. In recent years, productivity has climbed, but median income has not increased at the same rate. In this project, we attempt to analyze the discrepancies between productivity and median income in Canada. We used GDP as a measure of productivity, and median income as measure of worker compensation.
